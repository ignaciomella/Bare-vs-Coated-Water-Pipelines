# Bare-vs-Coated-Water-Pipelines
This is a collaborative White Paper comparing bare steel (corrosion allowance) versus inner epoxy coating as corrosion mitigation strategies for pipelines for water transport. 

This study evaluates the capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), including corrosion control, energy costs, and long-term maintenance.
