# Pipeline Coating Cost and Performance Analysis

Welcome to the **Pipeline Coating Cost and Performance Analysis** repository! This document explores the cost, performance, and inspection methodologies of field-applied and shop-applied coatings for steel pipelines, focusing on **Fusion Bonded Epoxy (FBE)** coatings and their applications in industrial pipelines. The analysis includes insights into cost disparities, technical challenges, and opportunities for improvement in pipeline coating practices.

## Repository Overview

This repository is a **living document**, designed to grow and improve through collaboration. It is not intended to be static but rather a dynamic resource that evolves with contributions from collaborators who share expertise, validate findings, provide references, or extend its scope. Whether you have detailed technical knowledge, practical experience, or constructive feedback, your input is welcome!

### Key Topics Covered
- Comparison of **factory-applied FBE coatings** vs. **field-applied liquid epoxy coatings**.
- Cost analysis: Field-applied coatings are **1,673 times more expensive per square meter** than shop-applied coatings for small cutback areas.
- Inspection methodologies: Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL), Ultrasonic Testing (UT), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), etc.
- Challenges of field applications: Heat-affected zones, contamination risks (e.g., ferrous oxide as shown in Photo 2), and coating adhesion.
- Innovations in pipeline coating technologies to eliminate the need for field joint coatings.

## Example: Current Focus Area

The following example highlights one area of analysis included in this repository:

### Field vs. Shop-Applied Coatings
Photo 1 illustrates a clean adhesion test result for a **factory-applied FBE coating**, showing uniform adhesion and no contamination. In contrast, Photo 2 demonstrates challenges with **field-applied liquid epoxy coatings**, including ferrous oxide contamination near weld seams. These challenges contribute to significant cost disparities between field and shop applications.

#### Key Insight:
Field-applied inner coatings are approximately **1,673 times more expensive per square meter** than shop-applied coatings due to higher labor costs, environmental variability, and specialized equipment requirements.
